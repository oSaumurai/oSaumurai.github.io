(A stronger player keeps getting advantages and growing stronger until it leads to insurmountable lead)</li><li>Dominant Objects - are part of the game that are simply better option for a player to take if they want to do well at the game. (Rock Scissor Paper Trap: you think rock would beat paper half of time on top of beating scissors all the time, rock in this case has a better chance of winning)</li><li>Starting Position: The resources and abilities that begin with impacts the fairness. Example: double the starting money on Monopoly. Most billionaires in real world come from a exceedingly wealthy parents. </li><li>Scripting: Built-in AI advantages.

The players have different starting positions and mechanics. Not really unfair, the game sells for unbalance itself. Part of the fun could be bringing the leader down. Having one part stronger is not a big deal as long as the player can see it and plan ahead. </p><p>Asymmetric gives more personalization.</p><p>Game does not have to be balance all the time.

Fibonacci sequence is commonly used for an interesting experience points progression.</li><li>Model your game - Create simulation of the game. Excels or Euros domains machinations to simulate AI driven playtests.</li></ul><p>Players skills, shenanigans are hard to predict. Brings back to Chance and RNG. Skills and chances are connected.

The elemental tetrad refers to aesthetics as a sensory rather than an emotional experience.</p><p>You got it, but I am going to give you the explanation to this question just to make sure that you got this question correct for the right reasons.</p><p>In the elemental tetrad, aesthetics refer to the sensory experience. As Schell defines it, “this is how your game looks, sounds, smells, tastes, and feels”.</p><p>In MDA, aesthetics refer to the desirable emotional responses that a player has when playing a game.</p><p>While there is certainly an argument to be made here that at a practical level these are very similar concepts, academically speaking there are some differences. In particular, Schell’s definition still has an objective side to it. The game objectively looks, sounds, smells and tastes a certain way. MDA however is entirely focused on player experience. While this might sound like a semantic difference, it is not, as it illustrates how the Tetrad is concerned with the elements of a game first and foremost, while MDA is concerned with the player experience above everything else.</p><p>Nonetheless, as the video indicates, you can practically use them as terms that are similar enough to each other when designing games.</p><h2 id="Which-are-the-dynamics-of-Battleship"><a href="#Which-are-the-dynamics-of-Battleship" class="headerlink" title="Which are the dynamics of Battleship?"></a>Which are the dynamics of Battleship?</h2><p>The back and forth in which players take pot shots trying to hit their opponent’s ships. </p><h2 id="For-a-space-pirate-game-which-of-the-following-dynamics-would-be-the-best"><a href="#For-a-space-pirate-game-which-of-the-following-dynamics-would-be-the-best" class="headerlink" title="For a space pirate game, which of the following dynamics would be the best?"></a>For a space pirate game, which of the following dynamics would be the best?</h2><p>Jeez, I don’t know.
