        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Marketing"><a href="#Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Marketing"></a>Marketing</h2><h3 id="Overall"><a href="#Overall" class="headerlink" title="Overall"></a>Overall</h3><p>You want to have a marketing plan from day 1. Your game will not be played if you do not promote it, so this is essential in getting a good portfolio piece.</p><p>For a minimal marketing plan, make sure to cover the following:</p><ul><li>Who is your target audience?<ul><li><em>Describe them, what does a day in their lives look like, what is their culture, what are their interests, what are their passions, why are they your audience?</em></li><li><em>Explain how will your game fit within their media diet and their lives in general?</em></li></ul></li><li>What other games like your game are popular with your audience, and - more importantly - what makes yours stand out?<ul><li><em>It is important to understand what your unique selling proposition is going to be. You are likely making a game with limited marketing and a smaller budget, so you need to have something that will make it stand out.</em> </li></ul></li><li>What are the key features of your game that will appeal to your audience?<ul><li><em>Relate your audience description back to key features, and explain why these are important to them.</em></li><li><em>Write up these features in a marketable way. Most games will literally list these key features in their marketing on online stores so figure out what those are for your game. Don’t make this overly complicated.</em></li></ul></li><li>Where does your audience finds its information? What online communities/subreddits/discord servers/hashtags do they frequent, and which of these are you going to be using to reach them?<ul><li><em>Be thorough about this. Just listing social media platforms is not what you need here. Describe specific communities within platforms and list what the rules of these communities are (if any). For example, while Twitter is pretty open, Reddit is very strict about what you can post on subreddits. (There is often a 1:10 ratio required between self-promotion and non-promotional posts for your account to be allowed to promote your work.)</em></li></ul></li><li>When is the best time to reach your audience on these platforms?<ul><li><em>Don’t put a random time here. Do your research and try to figure out when it is best to make a post. For example, here is <a href="https://thebetterwebmovement.com/choosing-best-time-post-to-reddit/">an article on what times to post on Reddit Links to an external site.</a>. However, don’t use this directly, as you need to think about your audience’s usage patterns as well.</em></li></ul></li><li>Why would your audience subscribe/follow/engage with your game and the marketing?<ul><li><em>What are the high level strategies that you are going to use to make your audience excited about your game and partake in its marketing? How are you going to make this an engaging and interactive experience for them.</em></li><li>Don’t just expect people to see a screenshot and be blown away. You want to think about how you can engage people. For example…<ul><li><em>If you have a great artists, it could be a good idea to have them do timelapse videos of their work and ask people to react.</em></li><li><em>You could give the community a voice in certain design choices that your team has to make.</em></li><li><em>Playtesting early builds can be a great way to get people engaged and talked about your project.</em></li><li><em>Identifying relevant events and doing something special about your game on that day can help.</em></li></ul></li><li><em>In the end, there are many ways to get your audience to engage with your content. Try to be creative and find things that work specifically for your project.</em></li></ul></li><li>What content are you going to release to appeal to your audience, and when are you planning to release specific content?<ul><li><em>Use the answers above to outline an actual week-by-week plan from today until either the end of the semester or your launch day that describes what content you are going to be releasing and what activities you are going to run to promote your game. Make this a part of your deliverables for this class and add it to your project plan (in your project management software) so that creating marketing materials is done on time and part of the project.</em></li></ul></li><li>When are you planning to release your game and in what form?<ul><li><em>The date matters as you do not want to conflict with bigger, competing launches or major sale events. Look up what releases are coming out and when it would be a good time to release your game.</em></li><li><em>You also have a choice on whether you want to do a full release or a pre-release or early access version. Again, you want to think about this as both have advantages and downsides.</em></li></ul></li></ul><p>To help your research, make sure to do a few searches on Statista. Northeastern gives you <a href="https://library.northeastern.edu/statista">free access to Statista Links to an external site.</a>and there is a lot of information for marketing purposes on there.</p><p>The goal of your plan is to build up an audience that wants to play your game, well before you are ready to release your game. Ideally, you want tens of thousands of people willing to download your game on release date, so that when you finally release it, the distribution platform’s algorithms will boost your game up to their front page.</p><p>To get to this point, you need to put out quality content related to your game at a regular interval: Show off your progress, talk about how cool the team is, ask people for advice and feedback, relate the game to online events, etc. and try to do all these things with high quality content as much as you can. In particular, try to post content that is unexpected, genuinely funny or technically impressive as much as you can.</p><p>A key part of your marketing plan is your launch day to do list.</p><h3 id="The-4Ps-but-only-3-here-of-Product-Management"><a href="#The-4Ps-but-only-3-here-of-Product-Management" class="headerlink" title="The 4Ps (but only 3 here) of Product Management"></a>The 4Ps (but only 3 here) of Product Management</h3><p>In marketing, we often talk about the 4 P’s: Price, Product, Place, and Promotion. However, for the scope of this class, we are going to focus on product, place and promotion.</p><h4 id="Product-What"><a href="#Product-What" class="headerlink" title="Product (What)"></a>Product (<em>What</em>)</h4><p>This is what you are selling. Your product should embody your brand identity.</p><p>Brand Identity as a function means the way that consumers will identify your product and differentiate it from the competition. This is stuff like your name, logo, symbol, characters (including your <em>team members</em> - tell people who you are and what you stand for), slogans, and design. Make these elements unique, memorable and consistent with each other and your brand meaning.</p><h4 id="Place-Where"><a href="#Place-Where" class="headerlink" title="Place (Where)"></a>Place (<em>Where</em>)</h4><p>Place, as far as this class is concerned, was somewhat covered above:</p><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>Where are you promoting/placing your product (and how will it be communicated to the consumer within that place)? To reiterate above, this includes placement through Reddit, Discord communities (including your own), Twitter, and other social medias. Figure out where you are going to promote your game and how your content will fit within that space.</li><li>Where will you distribute your product (but also <em>when</em> will you be distributing<em>)</em>? Are you going to distribute on Steam, itch.io, GameJolt, your own website, or even all of these? The answer to this question needs to be communicated and has implications for your marketing as well as different distribution platforms have different conventions.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="Promotion-How"><a href="#Promotion-How" class="headerlink" title="Promotion (How)"></a>Promotion (<em>How</em>)</h4><p>Promotion is asking questions such as “Where is my audience most commonly consuming information?” or “What is the ideal period for promoting a product?” or “How do competitors plan their promotions?”. You do not have the luxury to setup a perfect promotion since your timeline is already set to the timeline of the class, but you still want to think about these questions. More specifically, if certain events are going to happen that fit your game well in the semester during which you are taking this class, you might want to think about what you can do with that event. Similarly, you need to know where the audience of your game is consuming information about the games they download.</p><h2 id="Your-Marketing-Kit"><a href="#Your-Marketing-Kit" class="headerlink" title="Your Marketing Kit"></a>Your Marketing Kit</h2><p>It is strongly recommended to get the following:</p><ol><li>A press kit - Check out presskit() on IndieDB.com</li><li>A website - Set up a Wix, Wordpress or Squarespace for your game, or simply make a <a href="http://brukelgame.com/">one-page webpage yourself Links to an external site.</a>- I recommend <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap Links to an external site.</a>.</li><li>Store pages - Set up your page at the distribution platforms that you will be using and update them throughout your project.</li><li>Social media - Set up your social media accounts.</li><li>6 screenshots</li><li>A trailer (see below)</li><li>Some GIFs (see below)</li><li>A press list - Look up journalists that might want to write about your game and add their contact information to a list. Once you are ready to release, email them all your press release as well as inbox@gamespress.com.</li><li>Launch day list - A list of tasks that need to be completed on launch day to maximize the amount of traffic to your store pages.</li><li>A press release - When your game is ready, you want to let the world know through a <a href="https://medium.com/powerspike/the-last-how-to-write-a-game-dev-press-release-post-youll-ever-need-796aab9d7848">press release Links to an external site.</a>. For examples of professional press releases, check out <a href="http://gamespress.com/">gamespress.com.Links to an external site.</a></li></ol><p>Items 1-4 need to be done as soon as possible, preferably on day 1. The other items need to be completed and updated as you are making progress.</p><h2 id="Your-Key-Assets"><a href="#Your-Key-Assets" class="headerlink" title="Your Key Assets"></a>Your Key Assets</h2><p>Two key assets that you need for marketing are a trailer and some GIFs:</p><p>Use the following best practices for a trailer:</p><ul><li><strong>You have between 3 and 5 seconds to capture the viewer**</strong>’<strong>**s attention</strong>. Especially on the Internet where anyone can just move on to the next video. Get them hooked with a powerful intro!</li><li><strong>Write the trailer’s story beforehand, plan your work.</strong> Don’t just try to wing it, figure out what the narrative of the trailer will be before you make it.</li><li><strong>Use footage from the game</strong>! This is a game trailer. People want and expect to see your game. They want to know how the game plays and what they might buy.</li><li><strong>Have great music and sound effects</strong>. Sound is your best ally to convey a certain feel or emotion</li><li><strong>Use animated text and make it look as good as the in-game graphics</strong>. Use short expressions, up to 5 or 6 words long, to convey key pieces of information. In the trailer of Hollow Knight, a Metroidvania set in an underground world, the developers use phrases like “Forge your own path”, “Unleash the power of charms”, to great effect. </li><li><strong>End your trailer with a call to action</strong>. Tell the viewer where to get your game all what he should do after watching. If this is a launch trailer, you want people to know where they can buy your game (Apple and Google store, Steam, etc.) and where they can find your landing page</li><li>As an example, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAO2urG23S4">Hollow Knight Release Trailer (Links to an external site.)</a>.</li></ul><p>For a GIF, add the following:</p><ul><li>Make them part of your PR plan</li><li>Recycle your trailer by cutting it up in many gifs</li><li>Mind the 1st and last frame of your gif</li><li>Twitter - Movement stands out, experiment with #screenshotsaturday and #wipwednesday</li><li>Imgur - Blog post format, 1st frame and headline are key, don’t forget the #</li><li>Reddit - Learn the rules of the subreddits. Be part of the community.</li><li>Email - Post gifs in directly, mind the file size </li></ul>]]></content>

In other words, we are fine tuning the mechanics of our game in order to derive the attended aesthetics. There’s more to it than just mechanics.</p><h6 id="Common-balance-consideration"><a href="#Common-balance-consideration" class="headerlink" title="Common balance consideration:"></a>Common balance consideration:</h6><ul><li>Freedom vs Control</li><li>Length VS Pace</li><li>Economics</li><li>Rewards vs Punishment</li><li>Amount of choice</li><li>etc.</li></ul><h4 id="Source-of-Unfairness"><a href="#Source-of-Unfairness" class="headerlink" title="Source of Unfairness:"></a>Source of Unfairness:</h4><ul><li>Reinforcing relationship - winning at one element of the game reinforces somewhere else in the game, create a positive feedback loop that lead to a slippery slope mechanic. (A stronger player keeps getting advantages and growing stronger until it leads to insurmountable lead)</li><li>Dominant Objects - are part of the game that are simply better option for a player to take if they want to do well at the game. (Rock Scissor Paper Trap: you think rock would beat paper half of time on top of beating scissors all the time, rock in this case has a better chance of winning)</li><li>Starting Position: The resources and abilities that begin with impacts the fairness. Example: double the starting money on Monopoly. Most billionaires in real world come from a exceedingly wealthy parents. </li><li>Scripting: Built-in AI advantages. AI not smart enough, designer tweak the AI to make player feel competitive in Mario racing.</li></ul><p>Recommend Game Design Workshop by Tracy Fullerton</p><p><strong>Discuss:</strong></p><p>Some games are easier or header to balance. </p><p>Symmetrical game like chess have some challenges to make sure that there are no dominant pieces or the slippery slope of losing pieces does not get too bad.</p><p>Asymmetrical game, the award-winning board game root. The players have different starting positions and mechanics. Not really unfair, the game sells for unbalance itself. Part of the fun could be bringing the leader down. Having one part stronger is not a big deal as long as the player can see it and plan ahead. </p><p>Asymmetric gives more personalization.</p><p>Game does not have to be balance all the time. Might not apply to competitive game. Dark Soul can be fun when you play them.</p><h4 id="RNG-Random-Number-Generator"><a href="#RNG-Random-Number-Generator" class="headerlink" title="RNG - Random Number Generator"></a>RNG - Random Number Generator</h4><ul><li>Create simple math model</li></ul><h4 id="Balance-Tips"><a href="#Balance-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Balance Tips"></a>Balance Tips</h4><ul><li>Make Large adjustments (doubles and halves)</li><li>Document the process</li><li>Try self-balancing. Building in supply and demand in a game or letting player auction for certain items can reveal a lot about what was balanced well or not</li><li>Consider numerical relationships - look at relationships are between different elements of the game and how they progress through the game. Fibonacci sequence is commonly used for an interesting experience points progression.</li><li>Model your game - Create simulation of the game. Excels or Euros domains machinations to simulate AI driven playtests.</li></ul><p>Players skills, shenanigans are hard to predict. Brings back to Chance and RNG. Skills and chances are connected. For example, basket ball players free throw score chance.</p><p><strong>Discussion</strong></p><p>How do you feel about symmetrical versus asymmetrical game designs?</p><p>Does a game always have to be fair?</p><p>What is the most unfair game you have played an why?</p>]]></content>

However, money does not work that way. If we work on these variable ratio schedules of artificial rewards, we can make it so that people are motivated to keep playing out games pretty much forever. Video games are pretty like skinner boxes.</p>]]></content>

Challenge, curiosity and fantasy. </p><h3 id="How-to-balance-with-applied-goals"><a href="#How-to-balance-with-applied-goals" class="headerlink" title="How to balance with applied goals?"></a>How to balance with applied goals?</h3><p>The lists above can mess well with certain applied goals. For instance, combine fitness with competence. If we make a game in which we show people their progress, that can be very motivating.</p><p>Or say a game about language acquisition, that’s build around autonomy. In this game, you would go on these trips to virtual worlds where you meet fascinating foreigners to speak the language. </p><p>Might not that easy, say somebody would be able to find a sense of competence in their fitness workouts, they would probably be working out already. If somebody would find a lot autonomy and language acquisition, they would probably already be learning the language. People might not even intereted in these applied goals even though they would be very good for them to pursue anyways. </p><p>Brings us back to the problem, how do we motivate somebody to engage with our applied goals if they really don’t care for them. For example, how do you motivate a child to learn math if they don’t even like math. The answer is typically <strong>fantasy</strong>. For example, what if we would make a math game with high production values and use the avengers theme. Surely children would love to play? If we look at the research of <strong>Thomas Malone</strong>, that might not actually be the case, while the theme might be motivating, it can also interfere with learning. You see Thomas Malone did some research and he found that not all themes are equally as efficient at meeting certain learning outcomes, in particular the themes that were most effective for learning were the ones that he called <strong>Endogenous Fantasies</strong>. That means the <strong>game’s fantasy goals are the same as instructional goals</strong>. Say you are making a game about plant genetics. In the game you might mess with the genes of plants to create new plants or game about chemistry in which you’re puzzling chemical elements to create chemical compounds. In either case, you’re dealing with an <strong>endogenous fantasy</strong> and according to Malone, that would be optimal for learning. </p><p><strong>Exogenous Fantasies</strong> on the other hand or games in which the fantasy goals and the instructional goals don’t necessarily line up those are less effective. For example, according to Malone, if we would make a game about spelling in which you have to fight off a zombie apocalypse and save the world through spelling words would be less optimal. That means as designers, we can’t really sugarcoat a really boring topic with a very cool theme because we need to keep our fantasy as close to out instructional goals as possible or maybe not. </p><h4 id="Jacob-Habgood-did-the-same-research-but-in-different-angle-example-show-we-do-not-always-need-endogenous-fantasy-for-effective-learning-The-learning-happen-a-the-core-game-mechanics"><a href="#Jacob-Habgood-did-the-same-research-but-in-different-angle-example-show-we-do-not-always-need-endogenous-fantasy-for-effective-learning-The-learning-happen-a-the-core-game-mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Jacob Habgood did the same research but in different angle - example show we do not always need endogenous fantasy for effective learning. The learning happen a the core game mechanics."></a>Jacob Habgood did the same research but in different angle - example show we do not always need endogenous fantasy for effective learning. The learning happen a the core game mechanics.</h4><p>He states that the learning materials should not diminish the entertainment elements of a game. The fantasy does not have to be 100% in tune with the instructional goals <strong>as long as it is in tune with Core game machanics.</strong> He programmed a game to teach the vision . The fantasy of the game of which is something about fighting the skeletons of athletes that were cursed for cheating at the olympics but they are still weaing their jersey numbers ridiculous and entirely exogenous but inherently entertaining. </p><p>The <strong>mechanics</strong> is that to beat a skeleton you have to cleanly divide their jersey number. So a sword is two, a shield is three. A double sword swipe is 4 and so forth. So the skeleton with jersey number eighteen can be defeated using nine swords types of two, three sword shield combos of six, six single sheild bashes of three or two double shield bashes and nine. And also some combinations of all that such as three single shield batches of three and a final sheild batch of nine on top of it. Then you are really mastering your time table and building up some serious competence. In fact, you are adding some autonomy as well since you are deciding how to play the game and might also put you at a more optimal challenge too. So the game does quite well towards intrinsic motivation but the research also showed that it was teaching its players in an effective manner. Students who played the game for a week improved significantly from the control group on a post-test in recognizing heuristic patterns. For example, they recognized that number ending in 0 or 5 can be divided by 5 better than students that had not played the game.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><h3 id="Design-for-intrinsic-motivation"><a href="#Design-for-intrinsic-motivation" class="headerlink" title="Design for intrinsic motivation"></a>Design for intrinsic motivation</h3><h3 id="Make-Sure-your-core-gameplay-mechanics-match-the-learning-goals"><a href="#Make-Sure-your-core-gameplay-mechanics-match-the-learning-goals" class="headerlink" title="Make Sure your core gameplay mechanics match the learning goals"></a>Make Sure your core gameplay mechanics match the learning goals</h3><h3 id="Use-endogenous-fantasy"><a href="#Use-endogenous-fantasy" class="headerlink" title="Use endogenous fantasy"></a>Use endogenous fantasy</h3><p>Discuss: </p><ul><li>Share a game that was intrinsically motivating to play for you, and describe how it provided a sensee of autonomy, competence and relatedness for you</li><li>Do you have any examples of educational games that you learned a lot from, even if their themes were completely disconnected from what you were learning?</li></ul>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Skinner-Box"><a href="#Skinner-Box" class="headerlink" title="Skinner-Box"></a>Skinner-Box</h1><p>Preface: We are in a society of loyal Skinnerians, unable to think our way out of the box.</p><p>No wonder there had never been <strong>a book written for a general audience that showed how rewards undermine our efforts to teach students or manage workers or raise children — much less a broader critique that looked at all three arenas.</strong></p><p>Of this book’s twelve chapters, the first six lay out the central argument. Chapter 1 briefly reviews the behaviorist tradition, the prevalence of pop behaviorism in our society, and some reasons for its widespread acceptance. Chapter 2 weighs arguments about the intrinsic desirability of rewarding people, first challenging the claim that doing so is morally or logically required, and then proposing that there is actually something objectionable about the practice.</p><p>Chapter 3 moves from philosophical arguments to practical consequences, summarizing the research evidence showing that rewards simply do not work to promote lasting behavior change or to enhance performance; in fact, they often make things worse. Then, in chapters 4 and 5, I explain why this is true, offering five key reasons for the failure of rewards, all of which amount to serious criticisms of the practice apart from their effects on performance. Chapter 6 examines one particular reward that few of us would ever think to criticize: praise.</p><p>The second half of the book examines the effect of rewards, and alternatives to them, with respect to the three issues I’ve mentioned: employees’ performance, students’ learning, and children’s behavior. This part of the book is arranged so that readers primarily interested in only one of these topics won’t have to wade through discussions of the other two. Workplace issues are discussed in chapters 7 and 10, educational issues in chapters 8 and 11, and the question of children’s behavior and values (which is relevant to teachers as well as parents) in chapters 9 and 12. Serious readers will find that the endnotes provide not only citations for the studies and quotations but additional thoughts, qualifications, and discussion of the issues raised in the text.</p><h1 id="Chapter-1-Skinner-Boxed-The-Legacy-of-Behaviorism"><a href="#Chapter-1-Skinner-Boxed-The-Legacy-of-Behaviorism" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 1 Skinner Boxed: The Legacy of Behaviorism"></a>Chapter 1 Skinner Boxed: The Legacy of Behaviorism</h1><p>It is <strong>not true</strong> that “best way to get something done is to provide a reward to people when they act the way they want them to”. Rare inspection on “Do this and you’ll get that”.</p><p>Nothing wrong with the rewards themselves. That concerns the author is the practice of using these things as rewards. <strong>Trouble -</strong> To take what people want or need and offer it on a contingent basis in order to control how they act. </p><p><strong>Classical conditioning</strong> - When trained in classical conditioning, dog react to bell when there is no steak. </p><p><strong>Operant conditioning</strong>  - Skinner, “<strong>Reinforcement</strong>“. Action is controlled by stimulus that comes after it rather than before it.</p><p>This book is more about <strong>Operant conditioning</strong>. Not only interested in figuring out how rewards work; they are apt to argue that virtually everything we do — indeed, who we are — can be explained in terms of the principle of reinforcement. Man are treated as different animal from other animals only in the types of behavior he displays.</p><p><strong>Essence of behaviorism: </strong> it proceeds from a boundless faith in science—and specifically, a narrowly defined version of science that never caught up with modern physics—to tell us everything we need to know. Human beings are to be analyzed in precisely the same way as we would analyze “a chemical compound or the way a plant grows,” <strong>Anything that is not observable, testable, and quantifiable either is not worth our time or does not really exist.</strong></p><p>The consequence of patterning psychology after the natural sciences is <strong>predictable</strong>: psychology’s subject matter (us) is reduced to the status of the subject matter of physics and chemistry (things). When we try to explain things, we appeal to causes. When most of us try to account for human behavior, though, we talk about reasons; a conscious decision, rather than an automatic response to some outside force, usually plays a role. But for Skinner, our actions, too, can be completely described in terms of causes. Freedom is just an illusion. Remember, there is no “self” to be free: what we are is nothing other than what we do. This is the belief that gives behaviorism its name.</p><p><strong>It is important to understand that practice does rest on theory, whether or not that theory has been explicitly identified.</strong></p><h2 id="practices-that-rest-on-those-premises"><a href="#practices-that-rest-on-those-premises" class="headerlink" title="practices that rest on those premises."></a>practices that rest on those premises.</h2><p>Is it unfair to indict all of behaviorism on the basis of what Watson and Skinner had to say? Yes and no. It is true that they were more extreme than subsequent researchers and therapists on certain issues, such as the status of an inner life. Feelings, attitudes, and intentions were suspect to them—useless for explaining anything people do, completely determined by external factors, largely irrelevant to their version of psychology. In many intellectual movements, the pioneers are unreconstructed and immoderate; it is left to the next generation to temper and qualify and blend in what is useful from other theories. To some extent, behaviorism did move on while Skinner stood still. Long before his death, he was spinning in his house from what was being offered under the name of behavior therapy. (In his last paper, completed the night before he died, Skinner reiterated that “there is no place in a scientific analysis of behavior for a mind or self.”)<a href="javascript:void(0">15</a>)</p><p>But if more restrained and less quotable behaviorists have trimmed off the rough edges of Skinnerian psychology, they are carrying on a tradition that is fundamentally consistent with what I have been describing, at least with respect to the issues that matter most. They may have fastened on the finding that we also learn from watching other people receive rewards, or <em>that attitudes as</em> well as behaviors can be reinforced, but these are not decisive departures from Skinner with regard to what concerns us here.</p><p>More important, <em>we</em> can depart from Skinner at this point and begin to address ourselves to contemporary pay-for-performance plans in the workplace or the technique of pasting a gold star on a chart each time a child complies with her parents’ demands. To repeat, this book is intended as a critique of these sorts of practices, of pop behaviorism rather than of Skinner, so whether the vision of a seamlessly controlled Utopia like Walden Two chills you is beside the point. There is reason enough to be concerned once we reflect seriously on the implications of “Do this and you’ll get that.”</p><h2 id="Bring-In-the-Reinforcements"><a href="#Bring-In-the-Reinforcements" class="headerlink" title="Bring In the Reinforcements"></a>Bring In the Reinforcements</h2><p>Any time we wish to encourage or discourage certain behaviors—getting people to lose weight or quit smoking, for instance—the method of choice is behavioral manipulation.</p><p>“Why shouldn’t we pay teenagers not to have babies?”</p><p>One article, entitled “If Employees Perform, Then Reward ‘Em,” declares flatly, “The more money you offer someone, the harder he or she will work.”[24]</p><p><strong>praise</strong></p><h2 id="Behind-the-Appeal-of-Behaviorism-many-examples"><a href="#Behind-the-Appeal-of-Behaviorism-many-examples" class="headerlink" title="Behind the Appeal of Behaviorism (many examples)"></a>Behind the Appeal of Behaviorism (many examples)</h2><p>Intuitive people agree this idea. ethical conduct will be rewarded and evil acts punished. </p><p>Ironically, rewards and punishments not only lie at the core of faith but are central to our idea of rationality as well.</p><p>If you are a parent who has found that your children promptly make their beds when you promise them ice cream cones for doing so, you may conclude that rewards are effective. You may even decide that it is unrealistic to expect children to do such things if you don’t use them. </p><p>Typically, it is assumed that rewards will increase children’s interest in an academic assignment or their commitment to altruistic behavior. Even when presented with data indicating that the reverse is true, 125 college students in one experiment continued to insist that rewards are effective.(As we shall see, some research psychologists who champion behaviorism are just as likely to <strong>wave away data</strong> that <strong>contradict</strong> what they are sure is true.)</p><p> <strong>e.g. 1</strong>- In the middle of a lecture on behaviorism a few years ago in Idaho, one teacher in the audience blurted out, “But stickers are so easy!” This is absolutely true. If she finds herself irritated that children in her class are talking, it takes courage and thought to consider whether it is really reasonable to expect them to sit quietly for so long—or to ask herself whether the problem might be her own discomfort with noise.30 It takes effort and patience to explain respectfully to six-year-olds the reason for her request. It takes talent and time to help them develop the skill of self-control and the commitment to behave responsibly. But it takes no courage, no thought, no effort, no patience, no talent, and no time to announce, “Keep quiet and here’s what you’ll get….”</p><p><strong>e.g. 2 -</strong> Good management, like good teaching, is a matter of solving problems and helping people do their best. In many workplaces, incentive plans are used as a substitute for management: pay is made contingent on performance and everything else is left to take care of itself.</p><p><strong>They can do good teaching and management through good preparation, thoughts, patience, courage etc. However they using the brute force reward method</strong>. <strong>Doing this, unilaterally dispense reward, they did not respect the motivation, they are in lack of control of the motivation</strong></p><p><strong>Conclusions &amp; Answers:</strong>  The negative effects appear over a longer period of time, and by then their connection to the reward may not be at all obvious. The result is that rewards keep getting used. </p><h1 id="Chapter-2-Is-it-Right-To-Reward"><a href="#Chapter-2-Is-it-Right-To-Reward" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 2: Is it Right To Reward"></a>Chapter 2: Is it Right To Reward</h1><h2 id="Saving-Room-for-Just-Deserts"><a href="#Saving-Room-for-Just-Deserts" class="headerlink" title="Saving Room for Just Deserts"></a><strong>Saving Room for Just Deserts</strong></h2><p>It seems to follow, then, that people who do not succeed can be held responsible for their failure. Failure, after all, is prima facie evidence of not having tried hard enough. This doctrine has special appeal for those who are doing well, first because it allows them to think their blessings are deserved, and second because it spares them from having to feel too guilty about (or take any responsibility for) those who have much less.</p><p>The belief that rewards will be distributed fairly, even if it takes until the next lifetime to settle accounts, is one component of what is sometimes referred to as the “just world” view. It does not take much imagination to see where this sort of thinking can lead: one group of children, after watching a film about the Nazis, were reported to have said, “But the Jews must have been guilty or they wouldn’t have been punish</p><p><strong>Fear of Child-rearing to Social Laxity</strong> pay is not conditioned on performance we are sometimes said to be rewarding incompetence (or laziness) and giving some people a free lunch—a prospect that sends shudders through executive dining rooms.</p><p><strong>The basic idea that people should get what they deserve, which social scientists refer to as the equity principle</strong></p><p>In short, the <strong>equity model</strong>, as social psychologist Melvin Lerner put it, “<strong>applies to only a limited range of the social encounters that are affected by the desire for justice.</strong>“<a href="javascript:void(0">3</a>) Specifically, it is the favored mode of “impersonal, economic relations.”</p><p>A teacher frame learning as something one does in exchange for a prize rather than as something intrinsically valuable ?  -&gt; the decision to give any reward reflects a theory of learning more than a theory of justice.</p><h2 id="Treating-People-Like-Pets"><a href="#Treating-People-Like-Pets" class="headerlink" title="Treating People Like Pets"></a>Treating People Like Pets</h2><p>pop behaviorism is by its very nature dehumanizing. But I do not mean by that word merely that we are treated or understood as being on a par with other species; this is just a symptom. In the case of Skinnerian theory, the human self has been yanked up by its roots and the person reduced to a repertoire of behaviors. It is hard to imagine what could be more dehumanizing than the removal of what defines us as human.</p><p>In fact, even to suggest that we learn or work only in order to obtain rewards—an assumption held by behaviorists less extreme than Skinner—is not only inaccurate but demeaning as well.</p><p>The underlying theory of human nature, however, is not the only reason that handing out rewards (or, for that matter, punishments) is dehumanizing. That description also seems to apply because the practice is, at its core, neither more nor less than a way of trying to control people. Now there are circumstances, especially where children are involved, in which it is difficult to imagine eliminating all vestiges of control. (I will say more about this later.) But anyone who is troubled by a model of human relationship founded principally on the idea of one person controlling another must ponder whether rewards are as innocuous as they are sometimes made out to be.</p><p><strong>rewards simply “control through seduction rather than force.</strong> In the final analysis, they are not one bit less controlling since, like punishments, they are “<strong>typically used to induce or pressure people to do things they would not freely do</strong>“  or rather, <strong>things that the controller believes they would not freely do</strong>.</p><p>This is why one of the most important (and unsettling) things we can recognize is that the <strong>real choice for us is not between rewards and punishments but between either version of behavioral manipulation, on the one hand, and an approach that does not rely on control, on the other.</strong></p><p><strong>We recognize the status difference between the rewarder and rewardee, meanwhile the use of reward benefit the more powerful party - rewarder</strong></p><p><strong>One example:</strong> Imagine that you have given your next-door neighbor a ride downtown, or some help moving a piece of furniture, and that he then offers you five dollars for your trouble.</p><p><strong>Another example</strong>: a magazine editor who, after disagreements with others on the staff, was given to handing out bottles of wine or gift certificates</p><h3 id="Three-Objections-offers-remarks-concerning-control"><a href="#Three-Objections-offers-remarks-concerning-control" class="headerlink" title="Three Objections offers remarks concerning control"></a>Three Objections offers remarks concerning control</h3><ul><li><p>The first is the relatively modest point that it may be <strong>misleading to speak of rewards as inherently controlling, since some rewards are more controlling than others.</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>Control is an unavoidable feature of human relationships; all that actually varies is the subtlety of the system of reinforcement — more so, perhaps, since social rewards may have a more enduring effect than tangible rewards. Just because we cannot readily identify the operative operant doesn’t mean it isn’t there.</strong></p><ul><li>The introduction to a book entitled <em>Man Controlled</em> pretty well captures this perspective. Those who raise concerns about what the title suggests, we are told, simply have a “fear of new knowledge” that has been cultivated by “alarmists.” Realists recognize that “the technology of behavior control is not good or bad, but neutral”—therefore “not even an issue”—for the simple reason that there is no freedom (in fact, this word appears only within quotation marks) to be lost. Whether we like it or not, “all behavior is controlled…. The world is, in a sense, one large ‘Skinner box.’”</li><li>in fact, I argued earlier that rewards are just as controlling as punishments, and delicate rewards as controlling as heavy-handed ones.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Even if it is possible to avoid controlling other people, control is sometimes an appropriate, even desirable, mode of interaction, whether we use rewards or some other technique.</strong> It could even be argued that parents who fail to control their children are not living up to their responsibilities.</p></li></ul><h1 id="Chapter-3-Is-it-effective-to-reward"><a href="#Chapter-3-Is-it-effective-to-reward" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 3: Is it effective to reward?"></a>Chapter 3: Is it effective to reward?</h1><p>I will try to show in this chapter and the two that follow, they also change the way we do it. They offer one particular reason for doing it, sometimes displacing other possible motivations. And they change the attitude we take toward the activity. In each case, by any reasonable measure, the change is for the <strong>worse</strong>.</p><p>Skinnerian has written, the trouble “may be <strong>not that it doesn’t work</strong> but that <strong>it works only too well</strong>.”<a href="javascript:void(0">1</a>) I think exactly the same thing can be said of rewards: we pay a substantial price for their success.</p><h2 id="Do-Rewards-Change-Behavior"><a href="#Do-Rewards-Change-Behavior" class="headerlink" title="Do Rewards Change Behavior?"></a>Do Rewards Change Behavior?</h2><ol><li><p><strong>For whom are rewards effective?</strong></p><p>For what? When we look at the probability that rewards will change human behavior, a pattern begins to emerge, as two management specialists have noticed: </p><ul><li>Many of the early (and highly successful) applications of the principles of behavior modification have involved animals (such as pigeons), children, or institutionalized adults such as prisoners or mental patients. Individuals in each of these groups are <em>necessarily</em> dependent on powerful others for <strong>many of the things they most want and need, and their behavior usually can be shaped with relative ease</strong>.</li><li><strong>Laboratory animals are typically underfed</strong> to ensure their responsiveness to the food used as a reinforcer. Likewise, “<strong>in order to make people behave in a particular way … they must be …</strong> needy enough so that rewards reinforce the desired behavior.” People who have some degree of independence, will also respond to rewards on occasion, but it is more difficult to make this happen in a predictable, systematic way.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>For how long are rewards effective?</strong></p><p>The short answer is that they work best in the short term. </p><ul><li>What if he becomes satiated </li><li><p>what if his demands to be paid off escalate (in frequency if not in quantity) beyond your desire or ability</p><pre><code>when the goodies stop, people go right back to acting the way they did before the program began.

The basic design was ingeniously simple and, as tends to be the case in social psychology, a little deceptive. Each subject was asked to work on an interesting spatial-relations puzzle. Half were promised money; the other half weren’t. Then the experimenter announced that it would be a few minutes before the next phase of the study got started. The subject was left alone in a room to wait, where he or she could continue playing with the puzzle, read a magazine, or daydream.</p><p>Actually, this was the next phase of the study; the subjects were secretly watched to see how long they worked on the puzzle when they had a choice. Those who had been paid, it turned out, now spent less time on it than those who hadn’t been paid. It appeared that working for a reward made people less interested in the task. Or, as Deci put it, “money may work to ‘buy off’ one’s intrinsic motivation for an activity.”</p><p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Many teachers there used rewards to induce children to play with learning games, which they dutifully did. But when the rewards were no longer available, Lepper noticed that the kids wanted nothing to do with these activities anymore—whereas in classrooms that left it up to the children to decide what to play with, lots of them eagerly played with the very same games.</p><p>Despite the differences in design, the two experiments converged on a single conclusion: <strong><em>extrinsic rewards reduce intrinsic motivation.</em></strong> </p><p><strong>OLD MAN Joke</strong></p><p>An old joke captures this phenomenon as well as any study could. It is the story of an elderly man who endured the insults of a crowd of ten-year-olds each day as they passed his house on their way home from school. One afternoon, after listening to another round of jeers about how stupid and ugly and bald he was, the man came up with a plan. He met the children on his lawn the following Monday and announced that anyone who came back the next day and yelled rude comments about him would receive a dollar. Amazed and excited, they showed up even earlier on Tuesday, hollering epithets for all they were worth. True to his word, the old man ambled out and paid everyone. “Do the same tomorrow,” he told them, “and you’ll get twenty-five cents for your trouble.” The kids thought that was still pretty good and turned out again on Wednesday to taunt him. At the first catcall, he walked over with a roll of quarters and again paid off his hecklers. “From now on,” he announced, “I can give you only a penny for doing this.” The kids looked at each other in disbelief. “A penny?” they repeated scornfully. “Forget it!” And they never came back again.</p><p><strong>Most Memorable Studies:</strong> One of the most memorable studies to confirm this effect was conducted by a researcher whose specialty is the investigation not of rewards but of food preferences. <strong>Leann Lipps Birch</strong> and her colleagues at the University of Illinois took a group of children and got them to drink kefir, a fruit-flavored yogurt beverage they had never tasted before. The children were divided into three groups: some were just handed a full glass, some were praised (“That’s very good, you drank it all the way down”), and some were given a free movie ticket for drinking it. </p><p>Who drank more? Skinner, of course, would predict higher levels of consumption by those who received either verbal or tangible reinforcement. Was he right? Whenever I put this question to a group of people who have just listened to an account of how rewards are bad news, most of them now assume that everything Skinner says must be wrong—or at least that I wouldn’t bring up the study unless it refuted his prediction. In fact, though, his prediction is absolutely correct. If a reward is attractive enough, people will do almost anything to get it. A few extra gulps of liquid yogurt are surely worth a movie ticket.</p><p>But <strong>Birch</strong> was not interested in who would drink more kefir at the time the rewards were offered. What she wanted to know was <strong>how the incentives would affect the children’s long-term preferences</strong>. What she found was that <strong>those who got nothing for drinking it liked the beverage just as much, if not more, a week later</strong>. But <strong>those who had received tickets—or, to her surprise, praise—now found the stuff much less appealing</strong></p><p>The problem is not just that the effects of rewards don’t last—although, as we saw in chapter 3, that is true in one sense: long-term change of the kind we want is not effected by manipulating people’s behavior with incentives. The more significant problem is precisely that the effects of rewards do last, but these effects are the opposite of what we were hoping to produce. What rewards do, and what they do with devastating effectiveness, is smother people’s enthusiasm for activities they might otherwise enjoy.</p><h3 id="The-Scope-of-the-Effect"><a href="#The-Scope-of-the-Effect" class="headerlink" title="The Scope of the Effect"></a>The Scope of the Effect</h3><p><strong>There is no significant difference among Age, Race, Social Class, Sex</strong></p><p>Further scientific examinations of how rewards affect intrinsic motivation have turned up additional evidence of the extent of their destructive power. A single, one-time reward for doing something you used to enjoy can kill your interest in it for weeks.13 It can have that effect on a long-term basis, in fact, even if it didn’t seem to be controlling your behavior at the time you received it.14 The reward may also spill over to spoil your attitude about brand-new activities,15 in effect making you more dependent on extrinsic incentives generally. And just as you don’t have to be the one smoking a cigarette in order to be harmed by it, merely watching someone else get a reward for engaging in some activity can have at least a temporary motivation-killing effect.</p><h3 id="The-Reason-for-the-Effect"><a href="#The-Reason-for-the-Effect" class="headerlink" title="The Reason for the Effect"></a>The Reason for the Effect</h3><ul><li>Threatened</li><li>Watched</li><li>Expecting to be evaluated</li><li>Forced to work under deadline</li><li>Ordered around</li><li>Competing against other people</li></ul><h3 id="“But-If-We-Just”"><a href="#“But-If-We-Just”" class="headerlink" title="“But If We Just”"></a>“But If We Just”</h3><p>In some situations, we may be inclined to explain the consequences of using rewards by noting that whatever has to be done to get them is seen as just a <strong>prerequisite</strong>; </p><p>in other situations, we may notice that people lose interest by virtue of <strong>feeling controlled</strong>.</p><p><strong>Some Discussion about following statements.</strong></p><ul><li><p>“<strong>Two kinds of motivation are better than one.</strong>“ it’s not so easy to combine intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to make them more motivated. Finding a task interesting, which is both critical to excellence and highly desirable in itself, is usually eroded by the addition of a reward.</p></li><li><p>“<strong>As long as you don’t use rewards permanently, there’s no problem.</strong>“ Switching the baits are appealing but …</p></li></ul><p>Richard deCharms realized that the truth is quite different: giving someone an extrinsic reason for behaving in a certain way “changes the whole event; it does not just add a reward.” The Gestalt has been shifted; the perception of the task and of one’s motives may no longer be what they were.</p><ul><li>“<strong>Rewarding people is not only inevitable but apparently desirable since people want the goodies we give them.</strong>“</li></ul><p>To be sure, there is nothing wrong with offering a child acceptance and reassurance, but there is something very wrong with turning these into rewards that are provided only when the child acts in a certain way. In fact, <strong><em>the more you want what has been dangled in front of you, the more you may come to dislike whatever you have to do to get it.</em></strong></p><p>Deci and Lepper, with the kefir study and the logic of the old man’s plan, it becomes clearer how this vicious circle works. When we are repeatedly offered extrinsic motivators, we come to find the task or behavior for which we are rewarded less appealing in itself than we did before (or than other people do). Thereafter, our intrinsic motivation having shrunk, we are less likely to engage in the activity unless offered an inducement for doing so. After a while, we appear to be responsive to—indeed, to require—rewards. But it is the prior use of rewards that made us that way!</p><blockquote><p>As rewards continue to co-opt intrinsic motivation and preclude intrinsic satisfaction, the extrinsic needs … become stronger in themselves. Thus, people develop stronger extrinsic needs as substitutes for more basic, unsatisfied needs…. They end up behaving as if they were <strong>addicted to extrinsic rewards.</strong></p></blockquote><ul><li><p>“<strong>Let people reward themselves.</strong>“</p></li><li><p>“<strong>The only problem is that we are offering incentives for the wrong behaviors. If we made rewards contingent on people’s doing exactly what needs to be done, the problem would disappear.</strong>“ </p></li><li>“<strong>If we’re worried about reducing intrinsic motivation, then what’s the problem with giving people rewards for doing things they don’t find interesting?”</strong></li><li>“<strong>Some people are more extrinsically oriented than others.
