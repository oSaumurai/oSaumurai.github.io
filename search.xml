Your game will not be played if you do not promote it, so this is essential in getting a good portfolio piece.</p><p>For a minimal marketing plan, make sure to cover the following:</p><ul><li>Who is your target audience?<ul><li><em>Describe them, what does a day in their lives look like, what is their culture, what are their interests, what are their passions, why are they your audience?</em></li><li><em>Explain how will your game fit within their media diet and their lives in general?</em></li></ul></li><li>What other games like your game are popular with your audience, and - more importantly - what makes yours stand out?<ul><li><em>It is important to understand what your unique selling proposition is going to be. You are likely making a game with limited marketing and a smaller budget, so you need to have something that will make it stand out.</em></li></ul></li><li>What are the key features of your game that will appeal to your audience?<ul><li><em>Relate your audience description back to key features, and explain why these are important to them.</em></li><li><em>Write up these features in a marketable way. Most games will literally list these key features in their marketing on online stores so figure out what those are for your game. Don’t make this overly complicated.</em></li></ul></li><li>Where does your audience finds its information? What online communities&#x2F;subreddits&#x2F;discord servers&#x2F;hashtags do they frequent, and which of these are you going to be using to reach them?<ul><li><em>Be thorough about this. Just listing social media platforms is not what you need here. Describe specific communities within platforms and list what the rules of these communities are (if any). For example, while Twitter is pretty open, Reddit is very strict about what you can post on subreddits. (There is often a 1:10 ratio required between self-promotion and non-promotional posts for your account to be allowed to promote your work.)</em></li></ul></li><li>When is the best time to reach your audience on these platforms?<ul><li><em>Don’t put a random time here. Do your research and try to figure out when it is best to make a post. For example, here is <a href="https://thebetterwebmovement.com/choosing-best-time-post-to-reddit/">an article on what times to post on Reddit Links to an external site.</a>. However, don’t use this directly, as you need to think about your audience’s usage patterns as well.</em></li></ul></li><li>Why would your audience subscribe&#x2F;follow&#x2F;engage with your game and the marketing?<ul><li><em>What are the high level strategies that you are going to use to make your audience excited about your game and partake in its marketing? How are you going to make this an engaging and interactive experience for them.</em></li><li>Don’t just expect people to see a screenshot and be blown away. You want to think about how you can engage people. For example…<ul><li><em>If you have a great artists, it could be a good idea to have them do timelapse videos of their work and ask people to react.</em></li><li><em>You could give the community a voice in certain design choices that your team has to make.</em></li><li><em>Playtesting early builds can be a great way to get people engaged and talked about your project.</em></li><li><em>Identifying relevant events and doing something special about your game on that day can help.</em></li></ul></li><li><em>In the end, there are many ways to get your audience to engage with your content. Try to be creative and find things that work specifically for your project.</em></li></ul></li><li>What content are you going to release to appeal to your audience, and when are you planning to release specific content?<ul><li><em>Use the answers above to outline an actual week-by-week plan from today until either the end of the semester or your launch day that describes what content you are going to be releasing and what activities you are going to run to promote your game. Make this a part of your deliverables for this class and add it to your project plan (in your project management software) so that creating marketing materials is done on time and part of the project.</em></li></ul></li><li>When are you planning to release your game and in what form?<ul><li><em>The date matters as you do not want to conflict with bigger, competing launches or major sale events. Look up what releases are coming out and when it would be a good time to release your game.</em></li><li><em>You also have a choice on whether you want to do a full release or a pre-release or early access version. Again, you want to think about this as both have advantages and downsides.</em></li></ul></li></ul><p>To help your research, make sure to do a few searches on Statista. Northeastern gives you <a href="https://library.northeastern.edu/statista">free access to Statista Links to an external site.</a>and there is a lot of information for marketing purposes on there.</p><p>The goal of your plan is to build up an audience that wants to play your game, well before you are ready to release your game. Ideally, you want tens of thousands of people willing to download your game on release date, so that when you finally release it, the distribution platform’s algorithms will boost your game up to their front page.</p><p>To get to this point, you need to put out quality content related to your game at a regular interval: Show off your progress, talk about how cool the team is, ask people for advice and feedback, relate the game to online events, etc. and try to do all these things with high quality content as much as you can. In particular, try to post content that is unexpected, genuinely funny or technically impressive as much as you can.</p><p>A key part of your marketing plan is your launch day to do list.</p><h3 id="The-4Ps-but-only-3-here-of-Product-Management"><a href="#The-4Ps-but-only-3-here-of-Product-Management" class="headerlink" title="The 4Ps (but only 3 here) of Product Management"></a>The 4Ps (but only 3 here) of Product Management</h3><p>In marketing, we often talk about the 4 P’s: Price, Product, Place, and Promotion. However, for the scope of this class, we are going to focus on product, place and promotion.</p><h4 id="Product-What"><a href="#Product-What" class="headerlink" title="Product (What)"></a>Product (<em>What</em>)</h4><p>This is what you are selling. Your product should embody your brand identity.</p><p>Brand Identity as a function means the way that consumers will identify your product and differentiate it from the competition. This is stuff like your name, logo, symbol, characters (including your <em>team members</em> - tell people who you are and what you stand for), slogans, and design. Make these elements unique, memorable and consistent with each other and your brand meaning.</p><h4 id="Place-Where"><a href="#Place-Where" class="headerlink" title="Place (Where)"></a>Place (<em>Where</em>)</h4><p>Place, as far as this class is concerned, was somewhat covered above:</p><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>Where are you promoting&#x2F;placing your product (and how will it be communicated to the consumer within that place)? To reiterate above, this includes placement through Reddit, Discord communities (including your own), Twitter, and other social medias. Figure out where you are going to promote your game and how your content will fit within that space.</li><li>Where will you distribute your product (but also <em>when</em> will you be distributing*)*? Are you going to distribute on Steam, itch.io, GameJolt, your own website, or even all of these? The answer to this question needs to be communicated and has implications for your marketing as well as different distribution platforms have different conventions.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id="Promotion-How"><a href="#Promotion-How" class="headerlink" title="Promotion (How)"></a>Promotion (<em>How</em>)</h4><p>Promotion is asking questions such as “Where is my audience most commonly consuming information?” or “What is the ideal period for promoting a product?” or “How do competitors plan their promotions?”. You do not have the luxury to setup a perfect promotion since your timeline is already set to the timeline of the class, but you still want to think about these questions. More specifically, if certain events are going to happen that fit your game well in the semester during which you are taking this class, you might want to think about what you can do with that event. Similarly, you need to know where the audience of your game is consuming information about the games they download.</p><h2 id="Your-Marketing-Kit"><a href="#Your-Marketing-Kit" class="headerlink" title="Your Marketing Kit"></a>Your Marketing Kit</h2><p>It is strongly recommended to get the following:</p><ol><li>A press kit - Check out presskit() on IndieDB.com</li><li>A website - Set up a Wix, Wordpress or Squarespace for your game, or simply make a <a href="http://brukelgame.com/">one-page webpage yourself Links to an external site.</a>- I recommend <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap Links to an external site.</a>.</li><li>Store pages - Set up your page at the distribution platforms that you will be using and update them throughout your project.</li><li>Social media - Set up your social media accounts.</li><li>6 screenshots</li><li>A trailer (see below)</li><li>Some GIFs (see below)</li><li>A press list - Look up journalists that might want to write about your game and add their contact information to a list. Once you are ready to release, email them all your press release as well as <a href="mailto:&#105;&#110;&#x62;&#111;&#120;&#x40;&#103;&#97;&#109;&#101;&#x73;&#112;&#114;&#101;&#x73;&#115;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#105;&#110;&#x62;&#111;&#120;&#x40;&#103;&#97;&#109;&#101;&#x73;&#112;&#114;&#101;&#x73;&#115;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a>.</li><li>Launch day list - A list of tasks that need to be completed on launch day to maximize the amount of traffic to your store pages.</li><li>A press release - When your game is ready, you want to let the world know through a <a href="https://medium.com/powerspike/the-last-how-to-write-a-game-dev-press-release-post-youll-ever-need-796aab9d7848">press release Links to an external site.</a>. For examples of professional press releases, check out <a href="http://gamespress.com/">gamespress.com.Links to an external site.</a></li></ol><p>Items 1-4 need to be done as soon as possible, preferably on day 1. The other items need to be completed and updated as you are making progress.</p><h2 id="Your-Key-Assets"><a href="#Your-Key-Assets" class="headerlink" title="Your Key Assets"></a>Your Key Assets</h2><p>Two key assets that you need for marketing are a trailer and some GIFs:</p><p>Use the following best practices for a trailer:</p><ul><li><strong>You have between 3 and 5 seconds to capture the viewer<strong><strong>’</strong></strong>s attention</strong>. Especially on the Internet where anyone can just move on to the next video. Get them hooked with a powerful intro!</li><li><strong>Write the trailer’s story beforehand, plan your work.</strong> Don’t just try to wing it, figure out what the narrative of the trailer will be before you make it.</li><li><strong>Use footage from the game</strong>! This is a game trailer. People want and expect to see your game. They want to know how the game plays and what they might buy.</li><li><strong>Have great music and sound effects</strong>. Sound is your best ally to convey a certain feel or emotion</li><li><strong>Use animated text and make it look as good as the in-game graphics</strong>. Use short expressions, up to 5 or 6 words long, to convey key pieces of information. In the trailer of Hollow Knight, a Metroidvania set in an underground world, the developers use phrases like “Forge your own path”, “Unleash the power of charms”, to great effect. </li><li><strong>End your trailer with a call to action</strong>. Tell the viewer where to get your game all what he should do after watching. If this is a launch trailer, you want people to know where they can buy your game (Apple and Google store, Steam, etc.) and where they can find your landing page</li><li>As an example, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAO2urG23S4">Hollow Knight Release Trailer (Links to an external site.)</a>.</li></ul><p>For a GIF, add the following:</p><ul><li>Make them part of your PR plan</li><li>Recycle your trailer by cutting it up in many gifs</li><li>Mind the 1st and last frame of your gif</li><li>Twitter - Movement stands out, experiment with #screenshotsaturday and #wipwednesday</li><li>Imgur - Blog post format, 1st frame and headline are key, don’t forget the #</li><li>Reddit - Learn the rules of the subreddits. Be part of the community.</li><li>Email - Post gifs in directly, mind the file size</li></ul>]]></content>

(A stronger player keeps getting advantages and growing stronger until it leads to insurmountable lead)</li><li>Dominant Objects - are part of the game that are simply better option for a player to take if they want to do well at the game. (Rock Scissor Paper Trap: you think rock would beat paper half of time on top of beating scissors all the time, rock in this case has a better chance of winning)</li><li>Starting Position: The resources and abilities that begin with impacts the fairness. Example: double the starting money on Monopoly. Most billionaires in real world come from a exceedingly wealthy parents. </li><li>Scripting: Built-in AI advantages.

The players have different starting positions and mechanics. Not really unfair, the game sells for unbalance itself. Part of the fun could be bringing the leader down. Having one part stronger is not a big deal as long as the player can see it and plan ahead. </p><p>Asymmetric gives more personalization.</p><p>Game does not have to be balance all the time.

Fibonacci sequence is commonly used for an interesting experience points progression.</li><li>Model your game - Create simulation of the game. Excels or Euros domains machinations to simulate AI driven playtests.</li></ul><p>Players skills, shenanigans are hard to predict. Brings back to Chance and RNG. Skills and chances are connected.

Challenge, curiosity and fantasy. </p><h3 id="How-to-balance-with-applied-goals"><a href="#How-to-balance-with-applied-goals" class="headerlink" title="How to balance with applied goals?"></a>How to balance with applied goals?</h3><p>The lists above can mess well with certain applied goals. For instance, combine fitness with competence. If we make a game in which we show people their progress, that can be very motivating.</p><p>Or say a game about language acquisition, that’s build around autonomy. In this game, you would go on these trips to virtual worlds where you meet fascinating foreigners to speak the language. </p><p>Might not that easy, say somebody would be able to find a sense of competence in their fitness workouts, they would probably be working out already. If somebody would find a lot autonomy and language acquisition, they would probably already be learning the language. People might not even intereted in these applied goals even though they would be very good for them to pursue anyways. </p><p>Brings us back to the problem, how do we motivate somebody to engage with our applied goals if they really don’t care for them. For example, how do you motivate a child to learn math if they don’t even like math. The answer is typically <strong>fantasy</strong>. For example, what if we would make a math game with high production values and use the avengers theme. Surely children would love to play? If we look at the research of <strong>Thomas Malone</strong>, that might not actually be the case, while the theme might be motivating, it can also interfere with learning. You see Thomas Malone did some research and he found that not all themes are equally as efficient at meeting certain learning outcomes, in particular the themes that were most effective for learning were the ones that he called <strong>Endogenous Fantasies</strong>. That means the <strong>game’s fantasy goals are the same as instructional goals</strong>. Say you are making a game about plant genetics. In the game you might mess with the genes of plants to create new plants or game about chemistry in which you’re puzzling chemical elements to create chemical compounds. In either case, you’re dealing with an <strong>endogenous fantasy</strong> and according to Malone, that would be optimal for learning. </p><p><strong>Exogenous Fantasies</strong> on the other hand or games in which the fantasy goals and the instructional goals don’t necessarily line up those are less effective. For example, according to Malone, if we would make a game about spelling in which you have to fight off a zombie apocalypse and save the world through spelling words would be less optimal. That means as designers, we can’t really sugarcoat a really boring topic with a very cool theme because we need to keep our fantasy as close to out instructional goals as possible or maybe not. </p><h4 id="Jacob-Habgood-did-the-same-research-but-in-different-angle-example-show-we-do-not-always-need-endogenous-fantasy-for-effective-learning-The-learning-happen-a-the-core-game-mechanics"><a href="#Jacob-Habgood-did-the-same-research-but-in-different-angle-example-show-we-do-not-always-need-endogenous-fantasy-for-effective-learning-The-learning-happen-a-the-core-game-mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Jacob Habgood did the same research but in different angle - example show we do not always need endogenous fantasy for effective learning. The learning happen a the core game mechanics."></a>Jacob Habgood did the same research but in different angle - example show we do not always need endogenous fantasy for effective learning. The learning happen a the core game mechanics.</h4><p>He states that the learning materials should not diminish the entertainment elements of a game. The fantasy does not have to be 100% in tune with the instructional goals <strong>as long as it is in tune with Core game machanics.</strong> He programmed a game to teach the vision . The fantasy of the game of which is something about fighting the skeletons of athletes that were cursed for cheating at the olympics but they are still weaing their jersey numbers ridiculous and entirely exogenous but inherently entertaining. </p><p>The <strong>mechanics</strong> is that to beat a skeleton you have to cleanly divide their jersey number. So a sword is two, a shield is three. A double sword swipe is 4 and so forth. So the skeleton with jersey number eighteen can be defeated using nine swords types of two, three sword shield combos of six, six single sheild bashes of three or two double shield bashes and nine. And also some combinations of all that such as three single shield batches of three and a final sheild batch of nine on top of it. Then you are really mastering your time table and building up some serious competence. In fact, you are adding some autonomy as well since you are deciding how to play the game and might also put you at a more optimal challenge too. So the game does quite well towards intrinsic motivation but the research also showed that it was teaching its players in an effective manner. Students who played the game for a week improved significantly from the control group on a post-test in recognizing heuristic patterns. For example, they recognized that number ending in 0 or 5 can be divided by 5 better than students that had not played the game.</p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><h3 id="Design-for-intrinsic-motivation"><a href="#Design-for-intrinsic-motivation" class="headerlink" title="Design for intrinsic motivation"></a>Design for intrinsic motivation</h3><h3 id="Make-Sure-your-core-gameplay-mechanics-match-the-learning-goals"><a href="#Make-Sure-your-core-gameplay-mechanics-match-the-learning-goals" class="headerlink" title="Make Sure your core gameplay mechanics match the learning goals"></a>Make Sure your core gameplay mechanics match the learning goals</h3><h3 id="Use-endogenous-fantasy"><a href="#Use-endogenous-fantasy" class="headerlink" title="Use endogenous fantasy"></a>Use endogenous fantasy</h3><p>Discuss: </p><ul><li>Share a game that was intrinsically motivating to play for you, and describe how it provided a sensee of autonomy, competence and relatedness for you</li><li>Do you have any examples of educational games that you learned a lot from, even if their themes were completely disconnected from what you were learning?</li></ul>]]></content>

A good way is to always make sure that your creative choices are very mush substantiated and have good reasons behind them. For instance, you don’t want to eliminate rocket jumping from your fast-paced shooter because it wouldn’t work in the real world in the same way that you don’t want to include rocket jumping in a military simulation game. <strong>Make sure you why you design the game a certain way when people ask you</strong></p><h3 id="Pitch-Tips-3-Focus-on-what-really-matters"><a href="#Pitch-Tips-3-Focus-on-what-really-matters" class="headerlink" title="Pitch Tips 3: Focus on what really matters."></a>Pitch Tips 3: Focus on what really matters.</h3><p>This is two-parter as it applies to both how you talk about your game and how you are going to show it off. With regards to the game design, your pitch is not about your lore, it’s not even about your standard features so forget about guzzlefleber from the intro or that inventory system. It’s not what makes that game stand out and if that’s the case it shouldn’t be part of the pitch. Actually <strong>Brian Upton</strong> gave some excellent advice on this in a GDC talk. </p><ul><li>If you want to set up your game and you really need to do so, take the star wars approach, just a few words on screen and bam we’re shooting people with lasers. </li><li>General, just don’t get to the details that apply to every game in the genre. <strong>Get to where your game really stands out.</strong> </li><li><strong>HOOK: An easily communicated feature that makes your game unique.</strong> Because in the end, it’s always about convincing someone that your game is really worth their time and their money whether it’s a customer or a publisher. </li><li><strong>Why people would want to play it</strong></li><li><strong>Make sure that it’s very clear what is final and what is not final</strong></li></ul><p> [GDC] So You’re Ready to Pitch to a Publisher?

Most indie games don’t sell more than 5000 copies.

Chapter 2 weighs arguments about the intrinsic desirability of rewarding people, first challenging the claim that doing so is morally or logically required, and then proposing that there is actually something objectionable about the practice.</p><p>Chapter 3 moves from philosophical arguments to practical consequences, summarizing the research evidence showing that rewards simply do not work to promote lasting behavior change or to enhance performance; in fact, they often make things worse. Then, in chapters 4 and 5, I explain why this is true, offering five key reasons for the failure of rewards, all of which amount to serious criticisms of the practice apart from their effects on performance. Chapter 6 examines one particular reward that few of us would ever think to criticize: praise.</p><p>The second half of the book examines the effect of rewards, and alternatives to them, with respect to the three issues I’ve mentioned: employees’ performance, students’ learning, and children’s behavior. This part of the book is arranged so that readers primarily interested in only one of these topics won’t have to wade through discussions of the other two. Workplace issues are discussed in chapters 7 and 10, educational issues in chapters 8 and 11, and the question of children’s behavior and values (which is relevant to teachers as well as parents) in chapters 9 and 12. Serious readers will find that the endnotes provide not only citations for the studies and quotations but additional thoughts, qualifications, and discussion of the issues raised in the text.</p><h1 id="Chapter-1-Skinner-Boxed-The-Legacy-of-Behaviorism"><a href="#Chapter-1-Skinner-Boxed-The-Legacy-of-Behaviorism" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 1 Skinner Boxed: The Legacy of Behaviorism"></a>Chapter 1 Skinner Boxed: The Legacy of Behaviorism</h1><p>It is <strong>not true</strong> that “best way to get something done is to provide a reward to people when they act the way they want them to”. Rare inspection on “Do this and you’ll get that”.</p><p>Nothing wrong with the rewards themselves. That concerns the author is the practice of using these things as rewards. <strong>Trouble -</strong> To take what people want or need and offer it on a contingent basis in order to control how they act. </p><p><strong>Classical conditioning</strong> - When trained in classical conditioning, dog react to bell when there is no steak. </p><p><strong>Operant conditioning</strong>  - Skinner, “<strong>Reinforcement</strong>“. Action is controlled by stimulus that comes after it rather than before it.</p><p>This book is more about <strong>Operant conditioning</strong>. Not only interested in figuring out how rewards work; they are apt to argue that virtually everything we do — indeed, who we are — can be explained in terms of the principle of reinforcement. Man are treated as different animal from other animals only in the types of behavior he displays.</p>]]></content>

The elemental tetrad refers to aesthetics as a sensory rather than an emotional experience.</p><p>You got it, but I am going to give you the explanation to this question just to make sure that you got this question correct for the right reasons.</p><p>In the elemental tetrad, aesthetics refer to the sensory experience. As Schell defines it, “this is how your game looks, sounds, smells, tastes, and feels”.</p><p>In MDA, aesthetics refer to the desirable emotional responses that a player has when playing a game.</p><p>While there is certainly an argument to be made here that at a practical level these are very similar concepts, academically speaking there are some differences. In particular, Schell’s definition still has an objective side to it. The game objectively looks, sounds, smells and tastes a certain way. MDA however is entirely focused on player experience. While this might sound like a semantic difference, it is not, as it illustrates how the Tetrad is concerned with the elements of a game first and foremost, while MDA is concerned with the player experience above everything else.</p><p>Nonetheless, as the video indicates, you can practically use them as terms that are similar enough to each other when designing games.</p><h2 id="Which-are-the-dynamics-of-Battleship"><a href="#Which-are-the-dynamics-of-Battleship" class="headerlink" title="Which are the dynamics of Battleship?"></a>Which are the dynamics of Battleship?</h2><p>The back and forth in which players take pot shots trying to hit their opponent’s ships. </p><h2 id="For-a-space-pirate-game-which-of-the-following-dynamics-would-be-the-best"><a href="#For-a-space-pirate-game-which-of-the-following-dynamics-would-be-the-best" class="headerlink" title="For a space pirate game, which of the following dynamics would be the best?"></a>For a space pirate game, which of the following dynamics would be the best?</h2><p>Jeez, I don’t know.
